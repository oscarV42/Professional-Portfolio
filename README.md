# Professional-Portfolio

Purpose of this website was to create a standard portfolio that can be improved in the near future

This project was built to stand out to companies and show the work I have done in my interested field

I learned a little more about flex properties, they may still be confusing but I am getting more comfortable each time I am using it

Although the page my look amature, it's a start and can always be improved as i continue to do more work.
